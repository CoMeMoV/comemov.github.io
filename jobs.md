## Internships

The CoMeMoV partners often have opportunities for internships at the undergraduate level (LIFO, University of Orleans) and at the graduate level (all partners). If you are interested in an internship [send a CV and a cover letter](mailto:Frederic.Loulergue@univ-orleans.fr?subject=[CoMeMoV]%20Internship) indicating in particular which part of the project your are interested in and which partner you would like to join.
